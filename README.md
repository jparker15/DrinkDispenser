    a collection of Syrups. These syrups will have a name and a volume
    a collection of Shots. These will have a Flavor a volume and amount to dispense per shot.
    Three different CupHolders with sizes 'small' 'medium' large' (you can decide what those numbers are)

CupHolder details:
The CupHolder class will have

    Volume amount 
    Quantity 
    our cups are not smart cups so it won't be able to tell us if it's full or how full however it will be able to respond with it's size. 
    a dispenseCup() method that will return the volume of the cup and deduct one from it's quantity of cups.
    a refill(amt) method that will add amt to the quantity of cups
    Extra challenges:
    make the volume a static private field that can't be modified or accessed outside of the dispenseCup method.
    make the quantity field a private field so it can only be modified through the two methods.



Shots Details
the shots class will have:

    a flavor name
    current amount of liquid
    amount to dispense per "shot"
    a dispense() method that deducts the liquid for a single shot per call and returns the flavor of the shot.
    a getVolume method that will return the amount of shots remaining (not liquid amount the number of shots);
    Extra Challenges:
    make the fields all private.
    update the dispense method to see if there is enough liquid to dispense and if not return null instead of the flavor.
